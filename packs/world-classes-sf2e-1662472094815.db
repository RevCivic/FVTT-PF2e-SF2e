pharmaceutical compounds, which you can use to evaluate medical conditions and perform several additional tasks described below. You can configure your custom microlab to take the shape of anything that can fit in your hand or similar appendage. Alternatively, you can add it to an armor upgrade slot or to an augmentation system in your brain or an arm; it never takes up an armor upgrade slot or occupies a system in your body, so you can still use that slot or system for an armor upgrade or augmentation as normal. You must have your custom microlab on your person to use it, but you can configure it so it doesn&rsquo;t need to be in your hand to function.<br /><br />Your custom microlab counts as a basic medkit and a chemalyzer and can be used for any purposes applicable to those items. As long as you are in possession of your custom microlab, you can use Physical Science or Life Science instead of Mysticism to make serums, though these serums are not magic items, can be identified using Life Science or Physical Science rather than Mysticism, and do not require a detect magic spell to attempt such a check to identify.<br /><br />As long as you have your custom microlab, as a move action you can target a creature within your line of sight and within the microlab&rsquo;s range (60 feet at 1st level) and attempt a special skill check to identify it. If the creature is living, this is a Life Science check. If it is unliving, it&rsquo;s a Physical Science check. The DC of this check is determined by the creature&rsquo;s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table on page 133 of the Core Rulebook. You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and you always treat your die roll result as a 20.<br /><br />You can also attune your custom microlab to a number of individual creatures equal to 3 + your key ability modifier. This takes 10 minutes, which you can combine with the time needed to prepare your biohacks for the day, and the creatures must be present, willing, and able to cooperate with the scan. If you attune your microlab to creatures in excess of this number, the oldest attunements beyond your maximum number end. Otherwise, attunement lasts 24 hours, after which changes in environment and the target&rsquo;s condition require the microlab be re-attuned. Under some circumstances, you can deliver biohacks to attuned creatures using ranged injection weapons without making an attack roll.<br /><br />At 5th level, your custom microlab can function as an advanced medkit. At 9th level, it functions as a medical lab (with no increase to its bulk), and its range increases to 90 feet. At 17th level, its range increases to 120 feet.<br /><br />If your custom microlab is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen, you can kitbash a new one from any medkit or chemalyzer with 1 hour of work. You can have only one custom microlab at a time. If you create a new custom microlab, your old one functions as a normal item of whatever type you made it from.</p>\n<h1>Biohacks (Ex) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>As part of your custom microlab, you keep a specialized micropharmacy of catalysts, nanites, and specialized chemicals, plus a small mixing apparatus and syringes. You can use these components to quickly fashion biohacks: specialized solutions that produce different effects. In living targets, your biohacks alter normal biological processes; in nonliving creatures, they emulate biochemistry via complex chemical compounds. You can use biohacks to boost your allies or inhibit your foes. Your biohacks produce their effects only when you inject a creature with them (see below), and only you know how to make and administer them properly&mdash;a biohack that leaves your possession becomes inert until you pick it up again.<br /><br />You can deliver any biohack you create with any attack from an injection weapon. You must declare prior to the attack roll that you are using a biohack and specify which effect you are using, but you select and apply the biohack as part of the action used to make the attack. You do not need to preload your weapon with biohacks. If you are making a ranged attack and miss your target, the biohack is expended along with the attack&rsquo;s ammunition. A biohack delivered via a melee injection weapon is not normally expended on a missed attack. If you must attempt an attack roll with a biohack and your attack hits but deals no damage (normally as a result of damage reduction or an ability such as the vanguard&rsquo;s mitigate), the biohack is expended but the target is not affected by it. After a missed attack that does not expend the biohack, you can remove it or change which biohack you are using as part of your next attack without taking any additional action.<br /><br />You can also deliver a biohack using a physical syringe (from your custom microlab) that you can wield in one hand. This is considered a consumable basic melee weapon with negligible bulk, 1 Hit Point, and an item level and hardness equal to your biohacker level. To inject an unwilling creature with a biohack in this manner, you must hit them with a melee attack. This attack deals no damage, but if the creature would be damaged by 1 point of piercing damage, that creature is instead affected by the biohack within the syringe.<br /><br />A biohack can be injected into a willing or unconscious creature (or yourself) as a standard action without requiring an attack roll, as long as the target is within your reach. You can also use a ranged injection weapon to deliver a biohack to a willing ally you have attuned your custom microlab to as a standard action without making an attack roll, as long as they&rsquo;re within your custom microlab&rsquo;s range. Under any other circumstance, injecting a biohack into an ally at range requires a successful ranged attack roll.<br /><br />The materials you use to create biohacks are inert until you activate them. Once activated, they can be used to create any biohacks you know. Each day after you have rested for 8 hours, you can spend 10 minutes to activate the ingredients to create a number of biohacks equal to 1 + your key ability score modifier. This is the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. This preparation activates only the ingredients; you don&rsquo;t need to decide which specific biohacks you&rsquo;re creating until the actual actions or attacks used to deliver them. Activated biohack materials that aren&rsquo;t used that day become inert, even if they&rsquo;re still in your possession. You can readily replenish these inert reagents on a regular basis at no cost, unless the GM states otherwise. Whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can also prepare additional activated biohack ingredients to replace those you have used, up to your maximum.<br /><br />Biohacks come in two varieties: boosters and inhibitors. At 1st level, you know the basic boosters and inhibitors listed below, the minor boosters and inhibitors that follow, and the unique booster and inhibitor granted by your primary field of study. As you increase in level, you can also devise theorems to learn special biohacks, in addition to gaining biohacks from a secondary and a tertiary field of study. Additionally, most fields of study eventually provide you with breakthroughs: special biohacks described in their entries.</p>\n<h2>Basic Booster</h2>\n<p>A basic booster biohack aids a creature in one manner or another. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic booster biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target gains a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to skill checks.</li>\n<li>The target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to their speed. If the creature has more than one movement type, choose one to receive this bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Basic Inhibitor</h2>\n<p>A basic inhibitor biohack hinders a creature&rsquo;s physiology or material function. The effect of an inhibitor lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score modifier (minimum 1 round) unless it states otherwise. You begin play knowing this basic inhibitor biohack; when you use it, select an effect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The target takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target&rsquo;s DR by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n<li>You reduce the target&rsquo;s resistance to one type of energy (your choice) by 5. At 9th level, you instead reduce it by 10. At 17th level, you instead reduce it by 15.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A creature can be affected by only one of your basic inhibitors at a time, though it could be under the effects of multiple basic inhibitors originating from multiple biohackers. If you affect a creature with a different basic inhibitor while a previous inhibitor is still in effect, the effects of the previous inhibitor end.</p>\n<h2>Minor Biohacks</h2>\n<p>You can create minor biohacks from less powerful (and more stable) pharmaceuticals, nanites, and catalysts, and you can add them to any attack you make with an injection weapon that does not already have another biohack added to it. You don&rsquo;t need to activate the materials for minor biohacks in advance, and using them does not count against the maximum number of biohacks you can have ready at one time. Minor biohacks are otherwise used as and function as basic booster and basic inhibitor biohacks, and they count as such biohacks for the purposes of interactions with other abilities (such as spark of ingenuity).</p>\n<h3>Minor Booster</h3>\n<p>Using a minor booster biohack allows you to attempt some Medicine checks on targets you affect so long as the target is within range of your custom microlab. This doesn&rsquo;t require any additional time or action beyond making the attack. The tasks you can attempt with such a Medicine check depend on your level, and they don&rsquo;t have the duration of normal booster biohacks.<br /><br />At 1st level, you can attempt a Medicine check to administer first aid. At 3rd level, you can attempt a Medicine check to treat drugs or poison, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only on the next saving throw it attempts against the drug or poison, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour. At 6th level you can attempt a Medicine check to treat disease, though on a successful check, the target gains a +4 bonus only to the next saving throw it attempts against the disease, and that saving throw must occur within the next hour.</p>\n<h3>Minor Inhibitor</h3>\n<p>A minor inhibitor biohack imposes a slight hindrance on a target: the target takes a &ndash;1 penalty to attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your key ability score.</p>\n<h1>Injection Expert (Ex) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>You are proficient with weapons with the injection weapon special property, as long as the weapon has not gained that weapon special property through a weapon fusion, spell, class feature, or similar ability or effect. At 2nd level, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with these weapons. At 9th level, that bonus increases to +2, and at 18th level it increases to +3.<br /><br />When you hit an ally with such a weapon, you can avoid dealing damage to that ally, while still affecting the ally with the biohack booster or inhibitor, drug, medicinal compound, poison, serum, or other substance that was loaded into the injection weapon. When you fire a weapon with the injection special property and you have multiple types of ammunition loaded into the weapon, you choose which type of ammunition you fire when you attempt the attack.</p>\n<h1>Primary Field Of Study (Ex) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>Your primary field of study represents your scientific specialty. Choose your primary field of study upon taking your first level in biohacker&mdash;once made, this choice cannot be changed. A field of study grants you a unique booster and inhibitor, many of which work only on living creatures (not objects or creatures with the unliving universal creature rule) and have special properties and descriptors explained in their entries. At 5th level, you gain the breakthrough for your field of study.</p>\n<h1>Scientific Method (Ex) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>You have an innate mental gift, and a special way of approaching problems that lets you surpass normal researchers and scholars. If your key ability score is Intelligence, you have a studious mind. If your key ability score is Wisdom, you have an instinctive mind. Your scientific method affects your spark of ingenuity class feature (see below), and may impact how some other class features function, as noted in those abilities.</p>\n<h2>Studious</h2>\n<p>Your mind is a fortress of information that can rarely be breached. You gain a +1 bonus to Will saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 at 3rd level, +3 at 8th level, and +4 at 16th level. You also gain a +1 insight bonus to Life Science, Medicine, and Physical Science checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level, and every 4 levels thereafter. Additionally, you can add your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier to Perception and Sense Motive checks.</p>\n<h2>Instinctive</h2>\n<p>You can quickly intuit the connections between things and often act instinctively on those connections, gaining knowledge and aptitude without always being able to say how you picked it up. Select two skills&mdash;once made, this choice cannot be changed. You gain a bonus rank in each of these two skills at every level, as well as a +1 insight bonus to checks using these skills. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter. Additionally, you can add your Wisdom modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier to Life Science, Medicine, and Physical Science checks.</p>\n<h1>Theorem (Ex) - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>As you gain experience, you devise theories about the way the universe works. Some theorems you can apply to yourself, altering your physiological structure to gain specific benefits, while others require the use of your custom microlab or other equipment or add additional options for your biohacks.<br /><br />You learn your first theorem at 2nd level, and you gain an additional theorem every 2 levels thereafter. If a theorem allows an opponent a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier. If a theorem requires an opponent to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier. Unless otherwise specified, you can&rsquo;t learn a theorem more than once. Once you learn a theorem, that choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<h1>Spark Of Ingenuity (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>Possible permutations and offshoots of your formulas constantly run through your mind. Once per day, you can alter one of your biohacks to work in a different way, determined by your scientific method. You can do this one additional time per day at 9th level and at 15th level.<br /><br />If you are a studious biohacker, you can expend two uses of your biohack ability to combine the effect of two basic or minor biohacks (or one of each) into a single effect. This takes no additional time and allows a creature to be under the effects of two different basic or minor booster or inhibitor biohacks simultaneously. If the two effects have different durations, each effect ends after its normal time limit, though any with a duration measured in rounds last 1 round longer than normal.<br /><br />If you are an instinctive biohacker, when using a booster biohack, you can remove one of the following conditions, in addition to the booster&rsquo;s normal effects: dazzled, fascinated, or shaken. If you are at least 9th level, you can instead add the off-target condition as one of the effects imposed by any of your inhibitors, or you can remove any one of the following conditions with any of your boosters: dazzled, deafened, fascinated, fatigued, off‑target, shaken, or sickened. Alternatively, you can add the dazzled condition to the effects imposed by any of your inhibitor biohacks. This effect lasts the length of the inhibitor&rsquo;s duration.</p>\n<h1>Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with. For weapons you have gained proficiency with only through the injection expert class feature, rather than the normal Weapon Specialization benefit, you instead add half your character level to damage you deal with those weapons.</p>\n<h1>Secondary Field Of Study (Ex) - 7th Level</h1>\n<p>You choose a secondary field of study, which must be different from your primary field of study. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. You gain the unique booster and inhibitor biohacks for that field of study. At 11th level, you gain the breakthrough for your secondary field of study. When discussing your eduction, your secondary field of study is often referred to as your &ldquo;minor.&rdquo;</p>\n<h1>Tertiary Field Of Study (Ex) - 13th Level</h1>\n<p>You choose a third field of study, which must be different from your primary and secondary fields of study. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. You gain the unique booster and inhibitor biohacks for that field of study. At 17th level, you gain the breakthrough for your tertiary field of study.</p>\n<h1>Resolve Analysis (Ex) - 19th Level</h1>\n<p>Whenever you use your spark of ingenuity class feature, you regain 1 Resolve Point, up to your normal maximum.</p>\n<h1>Superserum (Su) - 20th Level</h1>\n<p>At 20th level, you have developed the formula for a superserum that can create powerful changes in a target. You can create two superserums per day. Your superserums are a special type of biohack, and you prepare them as part of the 10 minutes required to create your normal biohacks for the day. Your superserum produces one of the following effects; as with all biohacks, you decide on this effect as part of the attack or action you take to inject a creature with the biohack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grant major healing or bring a dead creature back to life. This functions as if you had cast raise dead or regenerate on the target, using your class level as the caster level.</li>\n<li>Scramble the physiological makeup of the target, causing massive internal damage. The target takes 17d10 points of damage and is exhausted and stunned for 1 round. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier), the damage is halved, and the target is instead only fatigued for 1 round.</li>\n<li>Relieve the target of debilitating conditions. Choose one set of ability scores: mental (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) or physical (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution). The target is healed of all ability damage to the chosen set of ability scores, and all ability drain from these ability scores is removed.

initiative checks and to skill checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Specialization - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>Your specialization represents your primary area of expertise. Pick one specialization upon taking your 1st level of the operative class. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. Descriptions of the specializations appear on page 94. Your specialization grants you the Skill Focus feat (see page 161) in your specialization&rsquo;s associated skills, and you gain a free skill rank in each of those skills at each operative level (this does not allow you to exceed the maximum number of skill ranks in a single skill).</p>\n<h2>Specialization Exploit - 5th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain your specialization&rsquo;s listed exploit as a bonus operative exploit, even if you don&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Specialization Skill Mastery - 7th Level</h2>\n<p>You become so confident in certain skills that you can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. When attempting a skill check with a skill in which you have the Skill Focus feat, you can take 10 even if stress or distractions would normally prevent you from doing so.</p>\n<h2>Specialization Power - 11th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain a special power depending on your specialization.</p>\n<h1>Trick Attack (Ex) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>You can trick or startle a foe and then attack when she drops her guard. As a full action, you can move up to your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative special property or with any small arm. Just before making your attack, attempt a Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check (or a check associated with your specialization; see page 94) with a DC equal to 20 + your target&rsquo;s CR. If you succeed at the check, you deal 1d4 additional damage and the target is flat-footed against your attack. This damage increases to 1d8 at 3rd level, to 3d8 at 5th level, and by an additional 1d8 every 2 levels thereafter. You can&rsquo;t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy special property or that requires a full action to make a single attack.</p>\n<h1>Evasion (Ex) - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>If you succeed at a Reflex save against an effect that normally has a partial effect on a successful save, you instead suffer no effect. You gain this benefit only when unencumbered and wearing light armor or no armor, and you lose the benefit when you are helpless or otherwise unable to move.</p>\n<h1>Operative Exploit - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>As you gain experience, you learn special tricks called operative exploits. You learn your first operative exploit at 2nd level, and you learn an additional exploit every 2 levels thereafter. If an operative exploit allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. If it requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. The list of operative exploits appears on page 95. You cannot learn the same exploit more than once unless it specially says otherwise.</p>\n<h1>Quick Movement (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>As long as you are unencumbered and wearing light armor or no armor, your land speed increases by 10 feet. At 9th level, your land speed instead increases by 20 feet, and at 15th level, your land speed instead increases by 30 feet.</p>\n<h1>Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency.</p>\n<h1>Debilitating Trick (Ex) - 4th Level</h1>\n<p>When you succeed at both the skill check and attack roll of your trick attack, you can make the target flat-footed or off-target until the beginning of your next turn. You might learn exploits that grant you additional options for your debilitating trick, but you can select only one option each time you hit with a trick attack.</p>\n<h1>Uncanny Agility (Ex) - 7th Level</h1>\n<p>You are immune to the flat-footed condition, and your opponent doesn&rsquo;t gain any bonuses to attack rolls against you from flanking you or attacking you when you&rsquo;re prone. Furthermore, covering fire and harrying fire don&rsquo;t provide any advantage against you.</p>\n<h1>Triple Attack (Ex) - 8th Level</h1>\n<p>When making a full attack using only melee weapons with the operative special property or small arms, you can make up to three attacks instead of two.</p>\n<h1>Quad Attack (Ex) - 13th Level</h1>\n<p>When making a full attack using only melee weapons with the operative special property or small arms, you can make up to four attacks instead of two.</p>\n<h1>Double Debilitation (Ex) - 17th Level</h1>\n<p>When you succeed at both the skill check and attack roll of your trick attack, you can apply two of your debilitating trick effects.</p>\n<h1>Supreme Operative (Ex) - 20th Level</h1>\n<p>Whenever you attempt a skill check with your specialization&rsquo;s associated skills, you can roll twice and take the higher result. Once per day as a move action, you can temporarily trade out one of your operative exploits for another operative exploit requiring the same level or lower. This trade lasts 24 hours. If the exploit you trade away is a prerequisite for any of your other abilities, you lose all abilities that require it as a prerequisite for the duration.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.aBkRuYZozsoWnV4Z","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.QbLcevCrFzMfyAZM","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.I52gH8e2eRjxX01S","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.1sgU1gVSQBdSvt9O","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"FlatModifier","type":"ability","ability":"dex","selector":"piloting"},{"key":"FlatModifier","type":"ability","ability":"int","selector":"medicine"}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.751,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-30T22:13:56.591-04:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.10.4.11747"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex"]},"items":{},"hp":10,"trainedSkills":{"value":["ste"],"additional":8,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":2,"will":2},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"Advanced Weapons (Ranged)","rank":1}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4MBUK7WvBUOgfwlr":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"pf2e-test","system":"pf2e","coreVersion":"9.269","systemVersion":"3.10.4.11747"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.cv1NyasH5v4GZKcw"}}}

A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.<br /><br />Only you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.</p>\n<h2>Lunar Weapon</h2>\n<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq023fy?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-35-Merchants-of-the-Void\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Starfinder #35: Merchants of the Void pg. 53</a><br />You have studied the delicate and luminous light reflected from a moon or similar celestial body, allowing you to bring forth an exquisite weapon made for graceful combat. This manifestation functions similarly to solar weapon, except it deals 1d4 damage at 1st level. This damage increases by 1d4 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter. Your lunar weapon also has the feint and operative special qualities (though it can&rsquo;t be used to make trick attacks, if you have that class feature). Unlike other melee weapons with the operative special quality, when you gain Weapon Specialization at 3rd level, you add your full solarian level to damage with your lunar weapon, as opposed to half. If you&rsquo;re a multiclass solarian, you add your full solarian level and half your levels in other classes to damage with your lunar weapon.</p>\n<h2><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"https://aonsrd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Solar Armor</h2>\n<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 101</a><br />You can form your solar mote into a suit of armor made out of stellar energy that outlines your body. This armor appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take whatever general shape you choose, whether glowing armored plates of solidified stellar energy, a form-fitting suit of crackling energy, or an aura of stellar plasma. Your solar armor&rsquo;s general design has no impact on its function and doesn&rsquo;t give the armor any special abilities. Once you&rsquo;ve selected the general design, you can&rsquo;t change it until you gain a new solarian level.<br /><br />Your solar armor grants you a +1 enhancement bonus to both your Kinetic Armor Class and your Energy Armor Class. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. It is compatible with light armor, but it gives you no benefit if you&rsquo;re wearing heavy armor or powered armor. At 5th level, you also gain energy resistance 5 while your solar armor is active. You can choose either cold resistance or fire resistance when you activate the armor, and can switch energy types as a move action. This energy resistance increases by 5 at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter.<br /><br />Forming or dismissing solar armor is a move action.</p>\n<h2><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"https://aonsrd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Solar Flare</h2>\n<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yef?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Character Operations Manual pg. 84</a><br />You can condense your solar mote around one of your hands to form a lightweight ranged weapon of stellar energy. This weapon appears to be made of either glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take any general shape you desire. The shape of normal ranged weapons&mdash;such as pistols, crossbows, and handcannons are fairly common&mdash;but more esoteric manifestations such as a shimmering crystal that launches fragments of itself, a dark aura that forms directly onto your foes, or an orb of stellar energy that releases beams of pure light are also possible. Your solar flare&rsquo;s general design has no impact on its function, and it doesn&rsquo;t give the weapon any weapon special properties. Once you&rsquo;ve selected the general design, you can&rsquo;t change it until you gain a new solarian level.<br /><br />Your solar flare functions as a one-handed uncategorized small arm that targets EAC (though it can&rsquo;t be used to make trick attacks, if you have that class feature), and you&rsquo;re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar flare deals cold damage or fire damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar flare deals 1d4 damage and has a range increment of 60 feet. This damage increases by 1d4 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter.<br /><br />Unlike most small arms, when you gain Weapon Specialization at 3rd level, you add your full solarian level to damage with your solar flare, as opposed to half. If you are a multiclass solarian, you add only your full solarian level and half your levels in other classes to damage with your solar flare.<br /><br />Any solarian class features (including stellar revelations and zenith revelations) that specifically affect melee weapons (such as the flashing strikes class feature) function with your solar flare, even if they normally work only with melee attacks. Anything that specifically affects solar weapons (such as&nbsp;solarian weapon crystals) affects your solar flare in the same way, though it can&rsquo;t gain any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion that can&rsquo;t be applied to a small arm.<br /><br />Forming or dismissing a solar flare is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar flare is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</p>\n<h2><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"https://aonsrd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Solar Shield</h2>\n<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yef?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Character Operations Manual pg. 84</a><br />You can coalesce your solar mote around one of your hands, creating a deflecting shield of out of stellar energy. This shield appears to be made of either glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can take any general shape you desire. Normal defensive implements such as bucklers and kite shields are popular shapes for solar shields, but it is not unheard of for a solarian to bear a solar shield in the form of a shining orrery orbiting their arm, a set of rapidly spinning helicopter blades across their forearm, or stranger barriers. Your solar shield&rsquo;s general design has no impact on its function, and it doesn&rsquo;t give the shield any special abilities. Once you&rsquo;ve selected the general design, you can&rsquo;t change it until you gain a new solarian level.<br /><br />Your solar shield grants you a +1 shield bonus to AC (see Shields on page 124), and as a move action you can align the shield to grant you greater protection against one opponent you are observing (Core Rulebook&nbsp;260), which increases your shield bonus to AC to +2 against attacks from that opponent until the beginning of your next turn. At 5th level and again every 5 levels thereafter, the shield bonus when aligned against one target increases by an additional +1.<br /><br />You can make unarmed attacks with your solar shield; these attacks are not archaic, and you threaten squares within your reach while it is formed. You can add solarian weapon crystals to your solar shield as if it were a solar weapon, in which case their benefits apply to unarmed attacks you make with the shield. The damage type of these attacks is the same damage type as the type granted by the&nbsp;solarian weapon crystal, and if the solarian weapon crystal does not specify a damage type, it deals bludgeoning damage.<br /><br />Forming or dismissing a solar shield is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar shield is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</p>\n<h2><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"https://aonsrd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Solar Weapon</h2>\n<p>Source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 101</a><br />You can seize your solar mote in one hand to form a melee weapon out of stellar energy. This weapon appears to be made out of glowing light or solid darkness, as determined by the appearance of your solar manifestation, but it can be whatever general shape you choose. Normal melee weapons like axes, swords, and spears are most common, but other shapes, such as a large rune of stellar energy, a mass of writhing energy tendrils, or an energized fist that fits over your own hand, are possible as well. Your solar weapon&rsquo;s general design has no impact on its function, and doesn&rsquo;t give the weapon any special abilities such as reach. Once you&rsquo;ve selected the general design, you can&rsquo;t change it until you gain a new solarian level.<br /><br />Your solar weapon functions as a one-handed kinetic advanced melee weapon with an item level equal to your solarian level, and you&rsquo;re automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter. Solarian weapon crystals (see page 170) can increase your solar weapon&rsquo;s damage.<br /><br />Forming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.</p>\n<h1>Stellar Mode (Su) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>The stellar forces you call on are attuned to either photons (representing the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or gravitons (representing the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). The ultimate expression of photon power is the supernova, when all of a star&rsquo;s energy is exerted outward, while the ultimate expression of graviton power is the black hole, where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The balance between these two opposing cosmic forces is the source of your power, and your stellar mode represents the strength of your connection with one or both of these forces&mdash;a relationship that shifts from one moment to the next as you use your stellar revelations.<br /><br />When in battle, you enter a state of metaphysical alignment with cosmic forces. At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).<br /><br />At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you&rsquo;re fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you&rsquo;ve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.<br /><br />At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.<br /><br />When you&rsquo;re not in combat, you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there&rsquo;s any doubt about whether you&rsquo;re in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don&rsquo;t pose a real threat to you.</p>\n<h2>Graviton Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter graviton mode, you gain 1 graviton attunement point and become graviton-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you&rsquo;re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2>Photon Mode</h2>\n<p>When you enter photon mode, you gain 1 photon attunement point and become photon-attuned. Some of your stellar revelations are photon powers and get stronger if you&rsquo;re photon-attuned. While photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.</p>\n<h2>Unattuned</h2>\n<p>While unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned. You gain no benefits while unattuned.</p>\n<h1>Stellar Revelation - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>As you gain experience, you uncover new secrets about the powers of energy, gravity, stars, and other fundamental sources of cosmic power that grant you the ability to channel these forces and manifest potent preternatural powers. At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br /><br />Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can&rsquo;t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you&rsquo;re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you&rsquo;re not in combat.</p>\n<h3>Disproportionate Revelations</h3>\n<p>If you devote yourself too strongly to one type of revelation, you fall out of harmonic alignment with the cosmic forces you access. You can have one more revelation of one type (either graviton or photon) than of the other type without penalty. If your revelations of one type outnumber those of the other type by two or more, you are considered attuned while you have from 1 to 3 attunement points in a stellar mode, and you do not become fully attuned to either stellar mode until you have accrued 4 attunement points in that stellar mode. For example, if you have three photon revelations and one graviton revelation, you would need 4 photon attunement points to be fully photon-attuned and 4 graviton attunement points to be fully graviton-attuned.</p>\n<h1>Sidereal Influence (Su) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You can tap into stellar forces outside of battle, using the properties of gravitons or photons to affect your skill use. At 3rd level, choose two skills from the lists below, one from the graviton list and one from the photon list. At 11th level and again at 19th level, choose two more skills. Each time you pick skills, choose one from the graviton list and one from the photon list.<br /><br />To use your sidereal influence, you must spend 1 minute in meditation, then choose either graviton skills or photon skills. When attempting a skill check with one of your selected skills of the chosen type (either graviton or photon), you can roll 1d6 and add the result as an insight bonus to your check. This ability lasts until you enter combat, fall unconscious, sleep, or meditate again to choose a different skill type. You can reactivate this ability by meditating again for 1 minute.<br /><br />Graviton Skills: Bluff (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Mysticism (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Stealth (Dex)<br />Photon Skills: Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Medicine (Int), Survival (Wis)</p>\n<h1>Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type for which this class grants you proficiency. If you selected solar weapon as your solar manifestation, it gains the benefit of Weapon Specialization as if it were an advanced melee weapon.</p>\n<h1>Flashing Strikes (Ex) - 7th Level</h1>\n<p>Your mastery of melee combat allows you to make multiple attacks more accurately. When making a full attack entirely with melee weapons, you take a &ndash;3 penalty to each attack roll instead of the normal &ndash;4 penalty.</p>\n<h1>Zenith Revelations - 9th Level</h1>\n<p>At 9th level and again at 17th level, you gain two powerful stellar revelations. Choose two revelations from the zenith revelations list: one graviton revelation and one photon revelation. The list of zenith revelations begins on page 107.<br /><br />Zenith revelations are powerful stellar revelations that require you to be fully attuned in a stellar mode. After using a zenith revelation, your stellar mode immediately becomes unattuned.</p>\n<h1>Solarian&rsquo;s Onslaught (Ex) - 13th Level</h1>\n<p>When making a full attack, you can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. You take a &ndash;6 penalty to these attacks instead of a &ndash;4 penalty. If you have the flashing strikes class feature, you instead take a &ndash;5 penalty to these attacks as long as they are all melee attacks.</p>\n<h1>Stellar Paragon (Su) - 20th Level</h1>\n<p>You are the spiritual kin of the stars themselves. As a move action, you can raise or lower light levels within 30 feet of yourself by one step. When you enter a stellar mode, you gain 2 attunement points of the corresponding type immediately and are considered attuned, and when you keep your current stellar mode at the start of your turn, you can gain 2 attunement points instead of 1, allowing you to become fully attuned after 2 rounds.<br /><br />In addition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain enough attunement points to be fully attuned on the first round of combat (but not after using a zenith revelation), or spend 1 Resolve Point at the start of your turn in combat to exchange all of your attunement points in one stellar mode for an equal number of attunement points in the other mode. For example, you can switch from being fully attuned in graviton mode to being fully attuned in photon mode.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Galactic Magic"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"piloting","type":"ability","ability":"dex"},{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"medicine","type":"ability","ability":"int"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.aBkRuYZozsoWnV4Z","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.QbLcevCrFzMfyAZM","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.I52gH8e2eRjxX01S","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.1sgU1gVSQBdSvt9O","replaceSelf":false}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.751,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-30T22:13:56.591-04:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.10.4.11747"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["cha"]},"items":{},"hp":12,"trainedSkills":{"value":["acr","arc","ath","dec","dip","itm","nat","occ","prf","rel"],"additional":4,"custom":"Piloting"},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":2,"will":2},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":1,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"Grenades","rank":1}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":1,"heavy":1},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4MBUK7WvBUOgfwlr":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"pf2e-test","system":"pf2e","coreVersion":"9.269","systemVersion":"3.10.4.11747"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.EYjMRmqif10YX3yk"}}}

To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + your Charisma modifier.<br /><br />You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2&ndash;3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2&ndash;4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells&mdash;note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells&mdash;these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br /><br />Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2&ndash;5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn&rsquo;t affected by your Charisma modifier.<br /><br />Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br /><br />You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.<br /><br />You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>\n<h1>Infinite Worlds (Su) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>As a standard action, you can create a bubble of altered reality, projecting elements of parallel existences into your current universe. You expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, you can create an instantaneous effect, such a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.<br /><br />All effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules unless they say otherwise. They have a range of 100 feet + 10 feet per witchwarper level and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If you create multiple effects with one use of infinite worlds, they all originate at the same point. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell level expended to create the effect + your Charisma modifier. You can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds however you wish (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.<br /><br />You can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When you do this, you select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend.<br /><br />For example, a 10th-level witchwarper could expend a 3rd‑level spell slot and select either a 3rd-level effect or any two abilities normally created by expending 1st- or 2nd-level spells.<br /><br />The environmental and instantaneous effects you can create by sacrificing a witchwarper spell slot of a given level are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st (Environmental):&nbsp;You cause the affected area to become difficult terrain. This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. You can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When you create difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li>\n<li>1st (Instantaneous):&nbsp;You cause a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude saves or be dazzled for 1 round per witchwarper level. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a &ldquo;1&rdquo;), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li>\n<li>2nd (Environmental):&nbsp;You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li>\n<li>2nd (Instantaneous):&nbsp;You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.</li>\n<li>3rd (Environmental):&nbsp;You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense&mdash;vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration.</li>\n<li>3rd (Instantaneous):&nbsp;You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li>\n<li>4th (Environmental):&nbsp;You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds&rsquo; environmental effects. The barrier is a number of 5-foot cubes no greater than double the level of the spell slot expended. The cubes must each connect along one side with at least one other cube, have hardness equal to double the level of the spell expended, and each have HP equal to 5 &times; the level of spell expended. Barriers you could summon might include old rusting barricades, slabs of ice, and so forth.</li>\n<li>4th (Instantaneous):&nbsp;You create a burst of damage affecting everything in the area. You select the type of damage each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic), and it deals 2d6 damage per level of the spell expended (Reflex half).</li>\n<li>5th (Environmental):&nbsp;You make the air thicker or thinner, or fill it with toxic vapors. Each creature breathing the air must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area. A creature attempts a single save when it is first exposed to the infinite worlds, which determines for the duration of the ability whether breathing within the area sickens that creature.</li>\n<li>5th (Instantaneous):&nbsp;You attempt to entangle all targets within the area. You might fill the area with chains, viscous glue, or quick-hardening cement. Each target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Creatures that enter the area after you use this ability are not entangled.</li>\n<li>6th (Environmental):&nbsp;You reduce the hardness of objects within the area by 50% (Fortitude negates), or increase their hardness by 10 (to a maximum of double their normal hardness).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Paradigm Shift - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>Paradigm shifts represent your ability to briefly install pieces of alternate realities into your own, subtly or radically changing your surroundings for a time. You learn your first paradigm shift at 2nd level, and an additional paradigm shift every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a paradigm shift last for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level. If a paradigm shift allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your witchwarper level + your Charisma modifier.<br /><br />Starting at 4th level, your ability to shuffle these realities improves. Upon gaining a witchwarper level (including at 4th level), you can swap out one paradigm shift you know for a different paradigm shift of the same level. You can instead select a paradigm shift of a lower level, but note the level of the original paradigm shift so that when you later swap out the same paradigm shift at later levels, you can select any paradigm shift of the original level or lower.)<br /><br />The list of paradigm shifts appears following the class features.</p>\n<h1>Compound Sight (Su) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You can sift through many realities, gaining understanding of a task by seeing it attempted dozens of different ways. Choose a skill. You gain a +1 insight bonus to checks using that skill. This bonus increases by +1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. You can change your chosen skill every time you gain a witchwarper level. At 9th level, you become more adept with your compound sight and can choose two skills to apply it to.</p>\n<h1>Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h1>Alternate Outcome (Su) - 6th Level</h1>\n<p>You can use your grasp of other realities to swap an outcome in your current existence with that of a more favorable reality. As a reaction once per day, you can reroll one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check that you attempt. Alternatively, you can expend a use of this ability as a reaction to cause a critical hit against you or an ally within 100 feet to instead be a normal hit.<br /><br />You gain one additional daily use of this ability at 12th level and again at 18th level.</p>\n<h1>Unfold Existences (Su) - 19th Level</h1>\n<p>You have nearly unlimited insight into all possible worlds and can pluck power from them as you deem necessary. Select five paradigms shifts you don&rsquo;t know but whose prerequisites you meet. These paradigm shifts must not require your level to be higher than 8th. You can use the selected paradigm shifts a total number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h1>Reality Stutter (Su) - 20th Level</h1>\n<p>Your force of will can infuse reality itself, changing key aspects of existence around you. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use any paradigm shift you know. This doesn&rsquo;t take an action, but you must use this ability on your turn unless the paradigm shift can be used as a reaction. If the paradigm shift requires a reaction, you still can&rsquo;t use it unless the stated trigger has occurred, but using it does not expend your reaction for the round. If the paradigm shift requires you to spend Resolve Points to use it, you must still spend those Resolve Points in addition to that spent to use this ability. You can use reality stutter only once per turn. You can use the unfold existences ability in conjunction with reality stutter; doing so expends a daily use of unfold existences as normal.<br /><br />Furthermore, once per week, you can cast warp reality as a spell-like ability.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"piloting","type":"ability","ability":"dex"},{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"medicine","type":"ability","ability":"int"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.aBkRuYZozsoWnV4Z","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.QbLcevCrFzMfyAZM","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.I52gH8e2eRjxX01S","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.1sgU1gVSQBdSvt9O","replaceSelf":false}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.751,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-06-16T00:42:31.430-04:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.10.4.11747"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["cha"]},"items":{},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":[],"additional":4},"perception":1,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":2},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":0,"other":{"name":"Grenades","rank":1}},"defenses":{"unarmored":0,"light":1,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4MBUK7WvBUOgfwlr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Vq8Mby8sXYElIeGg"}}}

To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + your Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 4&ndash;4: Mystic. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Wisdom modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 4&ndash;5: Mystic Bonus Spells&mdash;note that you only receive these bonus spells once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br /><br />Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new mystic level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 4&ndash;6: Mystic Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know isn&rsquo;t affected by your Wisdom modifier.<br /><br />Every time you gain a level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br /><br />You can cast any mystic spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a spell from a 2nd-level slot instead if you have one.<br /><br />You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem as a full action. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>\n<h1>Connection - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>You have a mysterious connection with some force that grants you magical powers. The exact nature of your connection can vary widely, and even mystics who share the same connection may interpret it differently. You must pick one connection upon taking your first level of mystic&mdash;once made, this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. Connections you can choose from begin on page 85.<br /><br />Many mystics serve as priests of various gods, and while you can theoretically choose any type of connection with any entity or concept, deities rarely grant connections that don&rsquo;t fit within their ethos (for example, Weydan, the god of freedom, is unlikely to look kindly on overlords). As such, each connection lists the deities and philosophies commonly associated with it.</p>\n<h2>Connection Power - 1st Level</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, 3rd level, and every 3 levels thereafter, you gain a connection power unique to your connection. If a connection power allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier. If the power requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your mystic level + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h2>Connection Spell - 1st Level</h2>\n<p>Your connection grants you additional spells known, one for each level of mystic spell you can cast, starting at 1st level and at any level when you normally gain access to a new spell level. These spells are in addition to the spells known listed on Table 4&ndash;6: Mystic Spells Known. These spells can&rsquo;t be exchanged for different spells at higher levels (except in specific cases; see below). The spell level of each spell is listed in your connection&rsquo;s entry.<br /><br />If your connection lists a single variable-level spell (see page 330) for all spell levels at the start of its spells entry, you gain that variable-level spell when you first get your connection spell for each level. The next time you gain a connection spell, add the next higher level of the variable-level spell to your list of spells known. You immediately lose the lower-level version of that variable-level spell and replace it with the listed connection spell for that lower level.</p>\n<h1>Healing Touch (Su) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to magically heal an ally up to 5 Hit Points per mystic level.</p>\n<h1>Channel Skill (Su) - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>You draw strange feelings, instincts, knowledge, and urges from your connection, augmenting your prowess in certain tasks. Each connection has two skills associated with it. You gain a +1 insight bonus to skill checks with your connection&rsquo;s associated skills. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Mindlink (Sp) - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>You can form a mental link with creatures you touch, communicating information rapidly through it. You can use&nbsp;mindlink&nbsp;at will as a spell-like ability, though only once per day on any given individual.</p>\n<h1>Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h1>Telepathic Bond (Sp) - 11th Level</h1>\n<p>As a standard action, you can form a telepathic link with up to six other willing creatures, allowing you to communicate telepathically at great distances. This functions as&nbsp;telepathic bond, except the duration is permanent. You can have only one telepathic bond active in this way at any given time; creating a new telepathic bond immediately ends the previous one.</p>\n<h1>Transcendence (Sp) - 19th Level</h1>\n<p>You are close to becoming one with your connection. You can cast each of your connection spells once per day without consuming a spell slot. In addition, you learn how to temporarily transcend your physical form. Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to project your consciousness outside of your physical body in the form of an intangible psychic image of yourself. This counts as a 6th-level illusion effect and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your mystic level. While your consciousness is projected, your physical body is considered blind, deaf, and helpless, but you can return to your body as a swift action. You control your psychic image as though it was your own body, and your senses perceive only what the image can see and hear. You move with a fly speed of 60 feet and perfect maneuverability. You can pass through solid objects as though you were incorporeal, but you can&rsquo;t go farther into a solid object than your space (5 feet for a Medium creature). You can&rsquo;t directly affect physical objects. Your projected consciousness is immune to most attacks or effects, whether or not they affect incorporeal creatures, but mindaffecting effects have their full effect on you.<br /><br />You can cast any mystic spell or spell-like ability with a range of touch or greater from your projected consciousness. The spells affect other targets normally. You can&rsquo;t cast any spells on your projected consciousness except for illusion spells. You need not maintain line of effect to your projected consciousness, but if you cross into another plane, even momentarily (including via Drift travel), your mind immediately returns to your physical body.</p>\n<h1>Enlightenment (Su) - 20th Level</h1>\n<p>You achieve enlightenment, becoming a living incarnation of your connection. You no longer age, nor do you die of old age. Once per day as a move action, you can enter a state of total communion with your connection that lasts for 1 minute. During this time, you gain a +4 insight bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and you gain 20 temporary Resolve Points that you can use only on connection powers. Any unspent temporary Resolve Points disappear at the end of this minute. In addition, once per week, you can cast&nbsp;miracle&nbsp;as a spell-like ability.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Starfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"piloting","type":"ability","ability":"dex"},{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"medicine","type":"ability","ability":"int"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.aBkRuYZozsoWnV4Z","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.QbLcevCrFzMfyAZM","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.I52gH8e2eRjxX01S","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.1sgU1gVSQBdSvt9O","replaceSelf":false}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.751,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-30T22:13:56.591-04:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.10.4.11747"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["wis"]},"items":{},"hp":10,"trainedSkills":{"value":["arc","dec","dip","itm","med","occ","rel"],"additional":6,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":2},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":0,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"Grenades","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":1,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4MBUK7WvBUOgfwlr":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"pf2e-test","system":"pf2e","coreVersion":"9.269","systemVersion":"3.10.4.11747"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.GXRZxRsWDVUv5QV2"}}}

the exact benefits vary by circumstance and are explained in the abilities below. At 5th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain and immediately use an additional nanite surge. You can use this ability multiple times.</p>\n<h1>Nanite Array (Ex) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>Your body hosts a multitude of nanites that you can direct to take one of three forms, called arrays. They can flood out of your body to form a cloud, combine to temporarily create items, or mobilize within you to amplify your physical abilities.<br />As a move action, you can direct your nanites to adopt an array. You can have only one array active at a time. Alternatively, you can use a nanite surge (above) to form or switch arrays as a swift action. The nanites maintain their array until you direct them into a different array, you fall unconscious, or you end your turn more than 10 feet from the array. If an array ends without being turned into a different array, the nanites disperse and return to your body at the beginning of your next turn and await further instructions. If you aren&rsquo;t within 60 feet of the array or the array is physically blocked from reaching you, the nanites instead break down, and you can&rsquo;t use your nanite array again until you spend 1 Resolve Point and take a full action to create a replacement array.<br />Your nanites are technological in nature and can be detected by spells (such as detect tech), but they aren&rsquo;t otherwise subject to effects that affect technology.<br />The three forms of nanite arrays&mdash;sheath, cloud, and gear&mdash; provide the following benefits only while the specific array is active.</p>\n<h2>Sheath Array</h2>\n<p>The nanite array reinforces your body, granting you a +1 enhancement bonus to Reflex saving throws and a +1 insight bonus to checks with two of the following skills: Acrobatics, Athletics, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth, selected when you form this array. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1.<br />When you form a sheath array, you can use a nanite surge to gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your nanocyte level; you lose any such remaining temporary Hit Points when the sheath array ends.</p>\n<h2>Cloud Array</h2>\n<p>You nanites spread out into a faintly visible cloud that fills a number of contiguous 5-foot squares. The maximum number of squares you can fill this way equals 1 plus your Constitution bonus, and at least one of those squares must be adjacent to you. The cloud is stationary once formed, though you can reconfigure its space as a move action; if you do so, at least one square of the cloud must remain unchanged. When you take a guarded step, you can move 10 feet as long as you begin and end this movement adjacent to or within your cloud array.<br />When you form a cloud array, you can use a nanite surge to increase the cloud&rsquo;s density. This causes the array&rsquo;s space to provide concealment, but it provides only a 10% miss chance. It doesn&rsquo;t provide enough concealment to hide, and your attacks ignore any miss chance provided by your cloud. This concealment doesn&rsquo;t stack with existing concealment.<br />At 3rd level, whenever you form a cloud array, it can fill an additional 5-foot square, and any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 15%. At 7th level, it can fill an additional 5-foot square, and any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 20%. At 11th level, the cloud fills up to a number of contiguous squares equal to 1 plus twice your Constitution modifier. At 15th level, when you use a nanite surge while forming the cloud array, any miss chance the cloud provides increases to 25% (though your attacks still ignore any miss chance). At 19th level, the cloud instead fills up to a number of contiguous squares equal to 1 plus four times your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<h2>Gear Array</h2>\n<p>Your nanites shape themselves into a single piece of equipment, such as a weapon, tool, or cybernetic augmentation. You can direct your nanites to create a limited selection of equipment, divided into major forms and minor forms. Major forms include weapons and cybernetic augmentations; minor forms include technological items (excluding armor and weapons) and personal items. At 1st level, you know how to create two major forms and three minor forms. You learn a new minor form at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter; you learn a new major form at 3rd level, 5th level, and every 4 levels thereafter. When you gain a nanocyte level, you can replace one of your major forms with a new major form and one of your minor forms with a new minor form.<br />To select a piece of equipment as one of your gear array&rsquo;s major or minor forms, its level must be equal to or lower than your nanocyte level. Augmentations must be cybernetic, weapons and items must be technological items (not magic or hybrid), and you can&rsquo;t select equipment that&rsquo;s consumed on use (such as grenades) or whose bulk exceeds your Constitution modifier.<br />When creating a nanocyte character at higher than 1st level, for simplicity, you can choose major forms by choosing one form using your nanocyte level, the next form using your nanocyte level &ndash; 1, the next using your nanocyte level &ndash; 2, and so on. Any extra forms use a nanocyte level of 1. You can choose minor forms the same way.<br />When you use your gear array to create a handheld nanite weapon, technological item, or personal item, you can automatically grab and begin wielding it if you have the requisite number of hands free. Otherwise, the item floats in your space until the end of your turn, at which point it drops in your space.<br />When you use your gear array to create a cybernetic augmentation, it&rsquo;s automatically installed in the appropriate body slot as long as that slot is empty; otherwise, it fails to manifest. If a given augmentation has a limited number of uses or frequency, that limit applies regardless of how many times you&rsquo;ve created it with your gear array. Equipment that requires a battery or ammunition to function must be loaded to function. When you create such equipment, you can have it absorb and automatically load one appropriately-sized battery or set of suitable ammunition in your possession. Any item that uses a battery with fewer than 20 charges can instead use a standard battery.</p>\n<h1>Primary Nanite Faculty - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>Whether by their design or your innovation, your nanites excel at a specialized task. Choose your primary faculty upon taking your first level in nanocyte&mdash;once made, this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. Descriptions of faculties appear on pages 11&ndash;13.</p>\n<h1>Primary Faculty Techniques - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>At 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a faculty technique unique to your primary nanite faculty.</p>\n<h1>Defensive Dispersal (Ex) - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>By using a nanite surge as a reaction when you take damage, you can protect yourself with your nanites when they create a temporary barrier or cause part of your body to temporarily disperse. You reduce the damage dealt by the triggering effect by an amount equal to your nanocyte level plus your Constitution modifier, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the first saving throw against the effect (such as the initial saving throw to resist a poison, but not subsequent saves against it).</p>\n<h1>Nanocyte Knack - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>As you gain experience, you learn special ways to use your nanites called nanocyte knacks. You learn your first nanocyte knack at 2nd level, and you learn an additional knack every 2 levels thereafter. If a nanocyte knack allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your nanocyte level + your Constitution modifier. If it requires an enemy to attempt a skill check, the DC is equal to 10 + 1-1/2 &times; your nanocyte level + your Constitution modifier. The descriptions of nanocyte knacks appear on pages 13&mdash;16. You can&rsquo;t learn the same knack more than once unless otherwise stated.</p>\n<h1>Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with, including any weapons for which you gained proficiency through a nanocyte knack.</p>\n<h1>Cyto-Conversion (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>As your connection to your nanites grows, the swarm&rsquo;s ability to break down and reassemble your body strengthens, gradually making you more machine than mortal. You receive a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against bleed, disease, poison, and sleep effects. In addition, you gain a 10% chance to treat a critical hit against you as a normal hit; it deals normal damage and doesn&rsquo;t apply any critical hit effect. This percentage doesn&rsquo;t stack with similar effects.<br />At 10th level, the circumstance bonus to saving throws increases to +2, and the chance to treat a critical hit against you as a normal hit increases to 20%. At 16th level, the circumstance bonus to saving throws increases to +3, and the fortification percentage increases to 30%.</p>\n<h1>Manifold Array (Ex) - 7th Level</h1>\n<p>With your improved command of your nanites, you split them into multiple arrays: a more potent primary array and a weaker secondary array. Your primary array calculates its effects using your full nanocyte level, whereas your secondary array calculates its effects using your nanocyte level &ndash; 4. You can create and sustain multiple clouds or pieces of gear simultaneously, though you can sustain only a single sheath array at a time. You must use separate actions to direct your nanites into each array.<br />At 15th level, you can split your array into three forms simultaneously: a primary form using your full level to calculate its effects, a secondary form using your level &ndash; 4, and a tertiary form using your level &ndash; 8.</p>\n<h1>Secondary Nanite Faculty - 9th Level</h1>\n<p>You choose another nanite faculty. Once you choose this second faculty, it can&rsquo;t be changed.</p>\n<h1>Secondary Faculty Techniques - 9th Level</h1>\n<p>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a faculty technique unique to your secondary nanite faculty. For the purposes of secondary faculty techniques that you obtain, treat your nanocyte level as equal to your nanocyte level &ndash; 8.</p>\n<h1>Eternal Nanites (Ex) - 11th Level</h1>\n<p>Your nanites recover quickly even from the most exhausting tasks. When you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, you regain a daily use of your nanite surge ability; at 18th level, you regain 2 daily uses instead. When you spend 1 Resolve Point to gain the benefits of a nanite surge, you also regain an additional daily use of your nanite surge.</p>\n<h1>Living Legion (Ex) - 19th Level</h1>\n<p>The effective level of your secondary nanite array increases to your level &ndash; 2, and the effective level of your tertiary nanite array increases to your level &ndash; 4. Once per day as a move action, you can supercharge your nanites, causing them to multiply and expand for 1 minute, granting you 10 temporary nanite surges. Any unused temporary nanite surges disappear at the end of this minute.</p>\n<h1>Infinite Array (Ex) - 20th Level</h1>\n<p>Once per day when you die from massive damage or from having 0 Hit Points and insufficient Resolve Points to stay alive, you can activate an emergency healing protocol. Using this ability on yourself takes no action. At the beginning of your next turn, your body and equipment disperse into a nanite mist, fly up to 30 feet, and reform, in the process restoring you to life. You reappear upright and wielding any combination of equipment in your possession, and you regain 1 Hit Point, all your Stamina Points, and 1 Resolve Point. You can then act on your turn as normal.<br />As a reaction, you can instead use a nanite surge to use this ability on an adjacent ally when they die under the same conditions. If you use a nanite surge when you use this ability, you can instead target an ally up to 20 feet away. You can use additional nanite surges to increase this range by 20 feet for each nanite surge used. The ally disperses, flies, and reforms at the beginning of their next turn.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Tech Revolution"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"piloting","type":"ability","ability":"dex"},{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"medicine","type":"ability","ability":"int"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.aBkRuYZozsoWnV4Z","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.QbLcevCrFzMfyAZM","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.I52gH8e2eRjxX01S","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.1sgU1gVSQBdSvt9O","replaceSelf":false}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.751,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-30T22:13:56.591-04:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.10.4.11747"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["con"]},"items":{},"hp":10,"trainedSkills":{"value":["acr","ath","cra","med","prf","ste","sur","thi"],"additional":6,"custom":"Piloting"},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":1,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":1,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"Grenades","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":1,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4MBUK7WvBUOgfwlr":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"pf2e-test","system":"pf2e","coreVersion":"9.269","systemVersion":"3.10.4.11747"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.zv1BHVb1Lleqfp6t"}}}

Descriptions of the fighting styles you can choose from appear on pages 112&ndash;115.</p>\n<h1>Primary Style Technique - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>At 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a style technique unique to your primary fighting style.</p>\n<h1>Combat Feat - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats.<br /><br />Whenever you gain a new bonus feat, you can also choose to replace one of the bonus feats you have already learned with a different bonus feat. The feat you replace can&rsquo;t be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat or other ability. You can change only one feat at any given level, and you must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time you gain the new bonus feat.</p>\n<h1>Gear Boost - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you learn a trick called a gear boost that make you better with a particular type of weapon or armor. Choose from the gear boosts listed below. Some gear boosts require you to reach a certain soldier level to select them; this level is indicated in parentheses after the boost&rsquo;s name.</p>\n<h1>Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You gain Weapon Specialization as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.</p>\n<h1>Secondary Fighting Style - 9th Level</h1>\n<p>You choose another fighting style. Once you choose this second style, it cannot be changed.</p>\n<h1>Secondary Style Technique - 9th Level</h1>\n<p>At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a style technique unique to your secondary fighting style.

You learn your first envoy improvisation at 1st level, and you learn an additional improvisation at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. The list of envoy improvisations appears on page 62.<br /><br />If an improvisation allows you to grant an effect to an ally, you cannot grant yourself that effect unless the improvisation states otherwise. If an envoy improvisation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your envoy level + your Charisma modifier.<br /><br />Some envoy improvisations are language-dependent, mind-affecting, sense-dependent, or some combination of any or all of these. These terms are defined on page 270.</p>\n<h1>Expertise - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>You are an expert at dealing with challenges that test your skills, be the challenges social or otherwise. At 1st level, when attempting a Sense Motive check, you can roll 1d6 (your expertise die) and add the result of the roll to your check as an insight bonus. You can use this and other expertise abilities as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining. At 5th level, anytime you roll your expertise die, you gain a +1 bonus to the result. At 9th, 17th, and 20th levels, this bonus increases by 1. At 13th level, you roll 1d8 as your expertise die instead of 1d6.<br /><br />Beginning at 9th level, you have even greater expertise with skills to which you can add your expertise die that you have also selected with the Skill Focus feat. For each such skill, once per day when rolling your expertise die to add to that skill, you may roll the expertise die twice and take the better of the two results.</p>\n<h1>Skill Expertise - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>At 1st level and every 4 levels thereafter, you can use expertise with one additional class skill. You must have at least 1 rank in a skill to select it, and it must come from the following list: Bluff (Cha), Computers (Int), Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Engineering (Int), Intimidate (Cha), and Medicine (Int).</p>\n<h1>Expertise Talent - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose an expertise talent, which gives you an extra option when using a skill with which you have expertise. The list of expertise talents appears on pages 64&ndash;65.</p>\n<h1>Weapon Specialization - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency.</p>\n<h1>True Expertise - 20th Level</h1>\n<p>You gain total mastery over one of your envoy improvisations and can use it with but a thought. When you gain this ability, choose one improvisation you know that has an effect when you spend 1 Resolve Point.<br /><br />As long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can gain the improvisation&rsquo;s effect without spending the Resolve Point. This ability has no benefit if the improvisation requires more than 1 Resolve Point.<br /><br />In addition, when you roll your expertise die, you can add 2d8 rather than 1d8+4 to the result of your skill check. If, for some reason, your bonus gained from expertise isn&rsquo;t 1d8+4, you can&rsquo;t use this option.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Starfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"piloting","type":"ability","ability":"dex"},{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"medicine","type":"ability","ability":"int"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.1sgU1gVSQBdSvt9O","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.I52gH8e2eRjxX01S","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.QbLcevCrFzMfyAZM","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.aBkRuYZozsoWnV4Z","replaceSelf":false}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.751,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-05-30T22:13:56.591-04:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.10.4.11747"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["cha"]},"items":{},"hp":10,"trainedSkills":{"value":["acr","ath","dec","dip","itm","prf","rel","soc","ste"],"additional":4,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":1,"reflex":1,"will":2},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":0,"other":{"name":"Grenades","rank":1}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":1,"heavy":0},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4MBUK7WvBUOgfwlr":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"pf2e-test","system":"pf2e","coreVersion":"9.269","systemVersion":"3.10.4.11747"},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Z7MulVLMGDu1TMJu"}}}

To you, the inevitable decay of the galaxy is simply a force to shape, control, and even temporarily reverse.

arrest, accelerate, or even reverse the typical course of events. This energy takes the form of a pool of Entropy Points (EP). You can have a maximum number of EP in your entropic pool equal to your Constitution modifier.<br /><br />You can gain Entropy Points only when involved in a combat encounter that includes a significant enemy (Starfinder Core Rulebook 242). When combat begins, you gain 1 Entropy Point at the beginning of your first action; at the end of combat, you lose any Entropy Points you have remaining. In addition to methods granted by vanguard aspects, you can gain Entropy Points in the followings ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you have no Entropy Points, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to gain 1 EP (2 EP at 10th level).</li>\n<li>Each time you take damage equal to or greater than twice your character level from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage, such as DR, energy resistance, or the mitigate class feature), you gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If you take damage from a critical hit, you gain 1 EP, in addition to any you gain from the attack&rsquo;s normal damage.</li>\n<li>If you score a critical hit on a significant enemy, you gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If you take a full action to charge, you gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>If you take two move actions on the same turn to move your speed each time, you gain 1 EP.</li>\n<li>As a move action, you can designate a willing adjacent ally as an entropic focus. They remain an entropic focus until the beginning of your next turn, unless they cease to be adjacent to you or you designate a new entropic focus (both of which end this effect). If your entropic focus takes damage equal to or greater than twice your character level from a single attack or effect (after applying any ability to reduce that damage, such as DR, energy resistance, or the mitigate class feature), you gain 1 EP. If you are at least 6th level, you can expend a Resolve Point to designate an adjacent, willing ally as your entropic focus as a reaction when they take damage (and gain EP from damage they take from the triggering attack, if appropriate).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Entropy Points can be expended in various ways, some of which you gain through vanguard aspects and disciplines. As long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point in your entropic pool, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your Armor Class.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As part of a full action to charge or a move action to move your speed, you can expend 1 EP to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your speed (normally land speed, but you can apply it to the speed for any movement type you have).</li>\n<li>As a move action, you can expend EP to boost the damage of the next entropic strike attack you make before the start of your next turn. You must decide how many EP to expend when you take this move action, and you can&rsquo;t expend more EP than your level. If the boosted entropic strike hits, you deal +1d4 damage for every EP expended.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Entropic Strike (Su) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>You can focus the power of entropy into a forceful attack. Though you must touch your target to damage it, the damage is not from the impact but from focused waves of entropic energy that unbind and dissolve your target, crush it, or both. Your entropic strike is a magical one-handed advanced melee weapon with the operative weapon special property that targets EAC (even when dealing bludgeoning damage). You can make this attack with nearly any body part and do not need a hand free to use this ability. Using your entropic strike does not require any additional action to use beyond the action you take to make an attack (for example, it can be used to make an attack of opportunity.) For any calculation that requires the item level of your entropic strike, treat your vanguard level as your entropic strike&rsquo;s item level.<br /><br />You can also deliver an entropic strike with any melee weapon, or any shield that allows you to make unarmed attacks (replacing the normal attack with your entropic strike). The attack&rsquo;s damage is equal to the entropic strike damage of a vanguard of either your class level or a class level equal to the weapon&rsquo;s item level, whichever is lower. When you use this option, your entropic strike is considered to be made of whatever material the weapon or shield is made of (such as for the purposes of bypassing DR or creature weaknesses). Additionally, you can apply any weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion the melee weapon or shield has to your entropic strike as long as the effect can be applied to a one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, doesn&rsquo;t use additional ammunition or charges, and doesn&rsquo;t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a bleed critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you are gaining the effect from.<br /><br />At 1st level, your entropic strike deals damage equal to 1d3 + your Constitution modifier, but you do not add your Strength modifier (unlike most melee attacks). For each attack, you can deal acid damage, bludgeoning damage, or both. This damage increases as you gain levels (see Table 2&ndash;2: Vanguard). At 10th level, you also add your Strength modifier to the damage of your entropic strike. At 5th level, when you use any combat maneuver for which you have Improved Combat Maneuver, you can target a foe&rsquo;s EAC + 8 (rather than KAC + 8) to determine success, and you also determine the level of success (such as how far you push a foe with a successful bull rush) using EAC.</p>\n<h1>First Vanguard Aspect - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>You have focused on one specific aspect of how entropy interacts with the universe, building a philosophy that goes far beyond mere physics. This aspect grants you an expanded command of the universe around you and teaches you important insights about matters that most people never connect to entropy.<br /><br />You select one vanguard aspect when you take your first level of vanguard. Once made, this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. Descriptions of the aspects you can choose from appear on pages 53&ndash;55. If an aspect ability allows a target to attempt a saving throw to resist its effects (including spell-like abilities), the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier unless stated otherwise.</p>\n<h2>Aspect Insight - 1st Level</h2>\n<p>Your understanding of a specific aspect of entropy gives you insight into combat and one specific skill that others rarely understand. You gain the Improved Combat Maneuver feat for the listed combat maneuver. Additionally, you gain a +2 insight bonus to checks with one skill determined by your aspect.</p>\n<h2>Aspect Embodiment - 4th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain an additional means of generating Entropy Points. If your aspect embodiment requires any interaction with another creature, that creature qualifies only if it is a significant enemy.</p>\n<h2>Aspect Catalyst - 12th Level</h2>\n<p>You have learned to create significant effects under certain conditions, guiding powerful forces with your subconscious mind. You gain an ability that you can use as a reaction the first time you take a critical hit in combat, or as a standard action by expending 4 Entropy Points. You can&rsquo;t use the ability again until you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.<br /><br />You also gain an improved version of the ability that you can use without taking an action the first time you reach 0 Stamina Points or 0 Hit Points in a combat encounter, expending all Entropy Points you have, if any. Once you use the improved version of the ability, you can&rsquo;t do so again for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>Aspect Finale - 18th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain a powerful ability unique to your aspect.</p>\n<h1>Mitigate (Ex) - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>You can control how you are affected by damage or effects that alter damage. As a reaction when you take damage, you can spend 1 Entropy Point to reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to your vanguard level (to a minimum of 0 damage). If you do, you can&rsquo;t gain any Entropy Points from that attack.<br /><br />Additionally, as a swift action, you can remove any DR or energy resistance you have, or the AC benefit of any ability or spell that increases your AC. If the effect granting DR or energy resistance has a duration, this ends the effect entirely for you. If you end an AC benefit, that AC benefit is ended for the duration of the effect. If the ability does not normally have a duration, you suspend the listed benefits until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, whenever you first come under the effect of an ability or spell that grants you DR, energy resistance, or a bonus to AC, you can waive that benefit of the effect.</p>\n<h1>Vanguard Discipline - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>Your close attention to the multivariate interactions between countless systems of order and disorder, combined with your study of advanced combat techniques, allows you to manipulate reality in devastating ways known as disciplines. You learn your first vanguard discipline at 2nd level and an additional discipline every 2 levels thereafter. The list of vanguard disciplines appears on pages 55&ndash;57. Unless otherwise specified, you can&rsquo;t select the same discipline more than once. If a vanguard discipline allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<h1>Reactive (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>Once per day, you can take an additional reaction during a single round, though you can still take only one reaction per triggering event. You can take a reaction before the first time you act in a combat, but not in a surprise round in which you are unable to act.<br /><br />At 9th level and again at 15th level, you can use this ability one additional time per day, though you can never use this ability to take more than two reactions in a round or one per triggering event.</p>\n<h1>Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency. You also gain a special form of weapon specialization for your entropic strike, allowing you to add a bonus to your damage equal to your vanguard class level plus half of any other class levels you have.</p>\n<h1>Entropic Attunement (Su) - 5th Level</h1>\n<p>As you learn to exert finer control over your entropic strike, you can enhance it to devastating effect. The saving throw DC for any of these effects that allow a saving throw is equal to 10 + half your vanguard level + your Constitution modifier.<br /><br />At 5th level, choose one of the following weapon special properties: breachAR, bright, feintAR, forceAR, or penetrating. Once made, this choice can be changed only when you gain a new vanguard level. As long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point, your entropic strike has the chosen special property.<br /><br />At 7th level, choose one of the following critical hit effects: corrode (1d8 for every 3 vanguard levels you have), knockdown, or staggered. Once made, this choice can be changed only when you gain a new vanguard level. Your entropic strike gains this critical hit effect as long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point. If your entropic strike has another critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can choose either the entropic attunement critical hit effect or the other critical hit effect. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Entropy Point to apply both critical hit effects.<br /><br />At 10th level, you can extend your field of entropy far enough that your entropic strike gains the reach weapon special property. The reach granted by this property increases by an additional 5 feet at 13th level, 16th level, and 19th level.<br /><br />At 13th level, just before making an attack, you can spend 2 Entropy Points to grant your next attack the blast weapon special property with a range of 20 feet. At 16th level, this range increases to 30 feet, and at 19th level, it increases to 60 feet.<br /><br />At 16th level, as a standard action you can use your entropic strike to strike the ground or clap your hands together to deal damage in a radius. Make a single melee attack roll and compare the result to the EAC of creatures and objects within 20 feet (other than yourself). You damage each creature and object with an EAC equal to or lower than the attack result. You can expend 1 EP to exclude a number of targets equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).<br /><br />At 19th level, as long as you have 1 Entropy Point, your entropic strike gains a second weapon special property, selected from those listed at 5th level. When you score a critical hit with your entropic strike, you can apply either the severe wound critical hit effect or any one of the critical hit effects listed at 7th level.</p>\n<h1>Uncanny Agility (Ex) - 7th Level</h1>\n<p>You are immune to the flat-footed condition, and your opponent doesn&rsquo;t gain any bonuses to attack rolls against you from flanking you or attacking you when you&rsquo;re prone. Furthermore, covering fire and harrying fire don&rsquo;t provide any advantage against you.</p>\n<h1>Second Vanguard Aspect - 8th Level</h1>\n<p>Your understanding of the many ways entropy can control the physical world expands. Select a second vanguard aspect, which must be different from your first vanguard aspect. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<h2>Second Aspect Insight - 8th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain the aspect insight benefit from your second vanguard aspect. If you already have the bonus feat granted by this aspect insight, you can instead select any other feat for which you meet the prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Second Aspect Embodiment - 17th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain the aspect embodiment benefit of the second vanguard aspect you selected at 8th level.</p>\n<h1>Flashing Strikes (Ex) - 11th Level</h1>\n<p>Your mastery of melee combat allows you to make multiple attacks more accurately. When making a full attack entirely with melee attacks, you take a &ndash;3 penalty instead of the normal &ndash;4 penalty.</p>\n<h1>Uncanny Speed (Ex) - 15th Level</h1>\n<p>When making a full attack, you can also take a separate move action to move. The movement can occur before, after, or between the attacks from the full attack. All the movement must occur at the same time. This is a haste effect.</p>\n<h1>Agent of Change (Su) - 19th Level</h1>\n<p>You begin each combat encounter with 3 Entropy Points.</p>\n<h1>Invulnerability (Su) - 20th Level</h1>\n<p>Once per day as a reaction, you become immune to all weapon special properties that impose penalties on you or that grant an attacker bonuses against you, as well as all combat maneuvers, conditions, critical hits, and critical hit effects, and you can take three reactions each round. These benefits last for 1 minute.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Character Operations Manual"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"piloting","type":"ability","ability":"dex"},{"key":"FlatModifier","selector":"medicine","type":"ability","ability":"int"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.aBkRuYZozsoWnV4Z","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.QbLcevCrFzMfyAZM","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.I52gH8e2eRjxX01S","replaceSelf":false},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.world.lores-sf2e.1sgU1gVSQBdSvt9O","replaceSelf":false}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.751,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-06-16T00:14:42.173-04:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"9.269","system":"3.10.4.11747"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["con"]},"items":{},"hp":12,"trainedSkills":{"value":["itm","occ","sur"],"additional":6,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":1,"will":2},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"Grenades","rank":1}},"defenses":{"unarmored":0,"light":0,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"4MBUK7WvBUOgfwlr":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.CCvKvAfKRgbzA38f"}}}

greater detail on pages 61&ndash;64). To learn or cast a spell, you must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level + your Intelligence modifier.<br />You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day can be found in Table 1&ndash;1: Precog above. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have an Intelligence modifier of +1 or higher, as shown in Table 1&ndash;2: Precog Bonus Spells (page 10)&mdash;note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells&mdash;these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.<br />Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new precog level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 1&ndash;3: Precog Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the numbers of spells you know isn&rsquo;t affected by your Dexterity modifier.<br />Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.<br />You can cast any precog spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell&rsquo;s level. You can also cast a spell using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.<br />You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.</p>\n<h1>Anchor - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>You have a preternatural affinity for an aspect of time itself that grants you power. Your anchor grounds your ability to interact with time and provides the foundation of all your powers. The exact nature of your specific anchor might be specific to you or be a broad element shared by other precogs. You must pick an anchor upon taking your first level of precog&mdash;once made, this choice can&rsquo;t be changed. The anchors you can choose from begin on page 11.</p>\n<h2>Focal Paradox 1st Level</h2>\n<p>Your anchor provides you a particular aptitude when using your paradox ability (below).</p>\n<h2>Improved Anchor 9th Level</h2>\n<p>You gain increased competence channeling your anchor into a powerful effect.</p>\n<h2>Greater Anchor 15th Level</h2>\n<p>Your mastery of your anchor provides you an exceptional ability.</p>\n<h1>Paradox (Su) - 1st Level</h1>\n<p>Your unique relationship with time allows you to dexterously manipulate its flow at key moments, allowing you to know what&rsquo;s going to happen before it transpires. Each day when you regain your spell slots, you also gain a number of paradoxes equal to 1 + half your Dexterity modifier (minimum 2) and lose any unused paradoxes from the previous day. Whenever you gain these or any other paradoxes, roll 1d20 for each and record the result associated with that paradox. You can never reroll paradoxes.<br />Many precog abilities allow you to use a paradox in place of a specific d20 roll you would make, using the paradox&rsquo;s associated result instead of rolling a random result. The paradox functions in every way like a normally rolled die; a paradox of 1 functions as a natural 1, and a paradox of 20 functions as a natural 20. You can&rsquo;t use a paradox for a die that has already been rolled or rerolled, and you can&rsquo;t reroll a paradox. Some precog abilities simply require you to use a paradox without using its associated result. Regardless of how you use a paradox, it is lost and can&rsquo;t be used again.<br />At 1st level, you can use a paradox in place of your d20 roll for an ability score check or caster level check. In addition, you can use a paradox on a d20 roll associated with your anchor&rsquo;s focal paradox; once per day when you do, you immediately gain a new paradox.<br />At 3rd level, you can also use paradoxes in place of your initiative checks, Reflex saving throws, and skill checks (for skills in which you are trained).<br />At 5th level, you can also use paradoxes in place of your attack rolls, Fortitude and Will saving throws, and skill checks (for skills in which you are untrained).</p>\n<h1>Temporal Anomaly (Su) - 2nd Level</h1>\n<p>Temporal anomalies represent your ability to channel your unique relationship with time into tangible actions. You learn your first temporal anomaly at 2nd level, and an additional temporal anomaly every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a temporal anomaly last for a number of rounds equal to your precog level. If a temporal anomaly allows for a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your precog level + your Dexterity modifier.<br />Unless otherwise specified, you can&rsquo;t learn a given temporal anomaly more than once. The list of temporal anomalies begins on page 12.</p>\n<h1>Chronomatic Defense (Su) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You can execute precisely timed moves that help you and others dodge incoming attacks. As a reaction when an attack is declared but before the result is known, you can use a paradox to grant an ally an insight bonus to AC until the end of your next turn. This bonus is equal to the paradox result or a maximum bonus of +2, whichever is lower. The maximum bonus increases to +3 at 7th level, +4 at 13th level, and +5 at 18th level.</p>\n<h1>Weapon Specialization (Ex) - 3rd Level</h1>\n<p>You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type with which this class grants you proficiency.</p>\n<h1>Temporal Aggression (Su) - 4th Level</h1>\n<p>You can view possible timelines and choose the precise moment that will inflict the most grievous injury upon your foes. When you roll damage dice, you can use a paradox in place of rolling any one damage die. If you do so, treat the result as either the value of the paradox or the maximum result of the damage die, whichever is lower. For example, you could use a paradox of 11 in place of a d10 damage die to get a value for 10 for that damage die. You can use this ability multiple times per damage roll, but only once per damage die. At 6th level, you can use this ability to replace an adjacent ally&rsquo;s damage dice.</p>\n<h1>Paradoxical Acceleration (Su) - 10th Level</h1>\n<p>You learn how to burn your personal reserves of energy to fuel a greater view of the timeline. As a standard action, you can spend 3 Resolve Points to gain 1 paradox.</p>\n<h1>Chronomatic Flow (Su) - 12th Level</h1>\n<p>Through your knowledge of time&rsquo;s flow, you can cast your spells with the exact timing necessary for maximum effect. As a swift action, you can use a paradox to increase the save DC on a spell you cast during your turn. This increase is equal to the paradox result or a maximum bonus of 1, whichever is lower. The maximum bonus increases to 2 at 16th level and 3 at 19th level.</p>\n<h1>Timeless Paragon (Su) - 20th Level</h1>\n<p>You exist in perfect synchrony with your timeline, gaining an impressive degree of control over your existence. You no longer age, nor do you die of old age. Once per week, you can act as though benefiting from a mnemonic editor, allowing you to change up to 2 character levels&rsquo; worth of decisions.
